Title: Housing Price Prediction using Regression Techniques

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict housing prices based on various features. 
Perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning, etc.

Some techniques that could be used in the Project:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Load and explore the California Housing Dataset (sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing â€” scikit-learn 1.4.1 documentationLinks to an external site.).
Handle potential missing values, outliers, and perform necessary data cleaning.
Visualize the data and identify relationships between features and the target variable (housing prices).


Feature Engineering:
Create new features from existing ones (e.g. combining categorical features).
Apply feature scaling or normalization techniques if necessary.
 

Model Building and Evaluation:
Split the data into training, evaluation, and testing sets (suggested ratio 7:1:2).
Implement and evaluate regression algorithms (You are free to choose any regression algorithm that you are most comfortable with).
Use appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, R-squared).
Perform k-fold cross-validation to estimate model performance.
 

Model Tuning and Selection:
Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
Select the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.


Model Prediction:
Use the trained model to make predictions on test data.
Analyze and interpret the predictions.

 

Additionally, you can consider extending the project by incorporating additional tasks, 
such as: Handling categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding; 
Exploring ensemble techniques like Stacking or Blending, etc.
